## Project Summary
Saucy is a responsive web application designed to help users discover and create cocktails using recipes found in the platform. By utilizing a cocktail API, Saucy offers an intuitive interface for users to search for cocktail recipes, find drinks by spirit, and explore cocktail suggestions from our randomizer.

### Key Features
1. Search Cocktail by Name: Users can quickly find their favorite cocktails by entering the name in a search bar. The application fetches and displays the corresponding recipe and image using the cocktail API.

2. Search Cocktail by Spirit: Users can select a specific spirit (e.g., Vodka, Gin, Rum, etc.) to find cocktails made with that ingredient. This feature helps users discover drinks based on what they have on hand.

3. Get Random Drink Recommendations: The randomizer feature suggests a cocktail at random, introducing users to new and exciting drinks they may not have considered.

### Technologies Used

## Stretch Goals
1. Favorites List: Users can save their favorite cocktail recipes for easy access later. This feature uses local storage to maintain a personalized experience without requiring user accounts.

2. Search by Ingredient: A feature to search for cocktails based on ingredients the user has at home, expanding the flexibility of the recipe finder.
